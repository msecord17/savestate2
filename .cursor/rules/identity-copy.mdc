# Identity copy rules (PASS 3 — crucial)

Apply these rules whenever writing or generating copy for Gamer Identity Card, Insight Rail, Era Strip, Collector Badge, or any identity/insight API output. **Never mix play and collector verbs.** This is a mirror, not a coach.

## Verb discipline

**Play signals:** played / completed / finished / returned to

**Collector signals:** own / collect / curate / preserve

**Inference:** looks like / tends to / often

**Never mix them.**

- ❌ “You completed many PS2 games” (from ownership)
- ✅ “You own a large PS2-era library”

## Confidence language

- **core** → declarative  
  “You are a Completionist.”

- **strong** → soft declarative  
  “Completionist tendencies show up strongly.”

- **emerging** → suggestive  
  “You may be leaning toward a Completionist style.”

## Insight tone rules

- No value judgment
- No leaderboard framing
- No “better than others”
- No “you should”

**This is a mirror, not a coach.**
