# Component rules

Apply these whenever editing GameCard, cover resolution, insight sections, or identity/insight copy.

## GameCard fallback order

1. **Game cover (IGDB)** — canonical
2. **Release cover** — only if game cover is null
3. **Neutral placeholder** — never platform art

Never use platform art (Steam header, PSN icon, Xbox art, RA screenshot) as the final fallback. Use a neutral placeholder.

## Insight density

- **One major insight per section**
- **Never stack more than 2 sentences**

## Tone rules

- “You tend to…”
- “It looks like…”
- “Based on…”

**No absolutes. No judgment.**
