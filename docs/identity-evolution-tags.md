# Ultra-Compact Evolution Tags (Locked v1)

All are **5–7 words**, readable at card size, emotionally legible without explanation. Grouped so you can mix, match, and A/B later.

**Design note:** These tags don’t imply skill, completion, or value judgment. They work for play data or collector-only users. They stack cleanly under archetype or era cards.
