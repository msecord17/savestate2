# Evolution Insight Copy (Locked v1)

Written to feel **observed over time**, not “leveled up.” This is the language that makes SaveState feel like a mirror instead of a scoreboard.

---

## Core framing (used everywhere)

**“Over time, your gaming habits have shifted.”**

Everything below hangs off that sentence. It signals **longitudinal truth**, not a snapshot.

---

## Evolution arcs (insight + compact)

### Explorer → Completionist

**Insight**  
Over time, you’ve shifted from sampling widely to finishing deliberately. You still explore — but now you care about seeing things through.

**Compact**  
From curiosity-driven to closure-driven.

**Stronger variant**  
You used to chase variety. Now you chase endings.

---

### Completionist → Explorer

**Insight**  
You used to focus on finishing everything. Lately, you’re more selective — playing what interests you, not what demands completion.

**Compact**  
From finishing everything to choosing freely.

---

### Explorer → Core Memory Player

**Insight**  
After years of trying everything, a few games started to stand out. You stopped searching — and started returning.

**Compact**  
From discovery to definition.

---

### Backlog Wrestler → Completionist

**Insight**  
Your library once grew faster than you could play it. Recently, you’ve been closing loops and turning backlog into history.

**Compact**  
From backlog-heavy to finish-focused.

---

### Completionist → Backlog Wrestler

**Insight**  
You used to finish almost everything you started. Now your interests move faster than your time — and that’s okay.

**Compact**  
From finishing clean to collecting broadly.

---

### Single-Platform → Multi-Platform

**Insight**  
You started in one ecosystem. Over time, your play spread across platforms, formats, and styles.

**Compact**  
From one home to many.

---

### Multi-Platform → Focused Platform

**Insight**  
You explored widely across platforms — then settled into the one that fits your life best.

**Compact**  
From everywhere to home base.

---

### Physical-First → Digital-First

**Insight**  
You once valued ownership and shelf space. Over time, convenience and access became more important.

**Compact**  
From shelves to servers.

---

### Digital-First → Physical Return

**Insight**  
After years of digital play, you found yourself returning to physical games — for permanence, nostalgia, or ritual.

**Compact**  
From access back to artifacts.

---

### Early Era → Modern Era

**Insight**  
Your gaming roots are older, but your habits evolved with the industry. You adapted without losing perspective.

**Compact**  
From cartridges to ecosystems.

---

### Modern Era → Retro Pull

**Insight**  
After years of modern systems, you’ve been drawn backward — revisiting older games with fresh eyes.

**Compact**  
From modern speed to retro depth.

---

### Parent Arc (console → handheld → couch co-op)

**Insight**  
Your play adapted to life. Handheld sessions replaced long nights — and now shared-screen moments matter most.

**Compact**  
From solo sessions to shared screens.

---

### Collector Evolution: Player → Archivist

**Insight**  
What started as play slowly became preservation. You began keeping track — then keeping history.

**Compact**  
From player to curator.

---

## Strength-aware evolution language

- **Emerging:** “You’re starting to shift…”
- **Strong:** “A clear change over time…”
- **Core:** “Your identity has fundamentally evolved…”

This lets the same insight scale without rewriting copy.

---

## Why this works

- It **never says when** the change happened (avoids false precision)
- It **never says why** (lets users project their own story)
- It **always implies time + evidence** without naming metrics
- It works for **play data and collector-only users**
