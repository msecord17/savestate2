# Icon → Color System (Locked v1)

Tight, opinionated system that scales, avoids visual noise, and stays honest about confidence. Framed as **rules**, not just a palette.

---

## 1. First principle (non-negotiable)

**Icons communicate meaning.**  
**Color communicates context + confidence.**

Never overload color with *what something is*. That’s the icon’s job. Color answers:

- **When** (era)
- **Why** (archetype motivation)
- **How sure** (confidence / inference)

---

## 2. Era-coded colors (backgrounds, accents — not icons)

Use **muted, nostalgic tones**, never neon. These should feel like memory, not UI chrome.

| Era | Color | Hex vibe | Meaning |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| **Early / Pre-NES** (Atari, Home Computing) | Burnt amber / sepia brown | #8C5A2B, #A06A3A | Origins, experimentation, archaeology |
| **NES / SNES** | Warm gray + muted red accent | #5A5A5A + #C94A3A | Foundations, muscle memory, purity |
| **PS1 / N64 / Saturn** | Cool slate + soft purple | #4E5D6C, #7A6FA3 | Transition, 3D uncertainty, discovery |
| **PS2 / Xbox / GameCube** | Deep indigo / midnight blue | #2F3B5C | Identity formation, “my era” |
| **PS3 / Xbox 360 / Wii** | Steel blue + achievement gold accent | #3E6A8C + #C9A24D | Metrics, mastery, proof |
| **Modern** (PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One+ / Switch / PC) | Neutral charcoal + platform tint | #1E1E1E | Scale, abundance, live ecosystems |
| **Handheld lineage** | Soft teal / sage | #4F8F8B | Intimacy, portability, life-fit |

**Use for:** Era labels, subtle card borders, backgrounds.

**Rule:** Era colors live in **containers, dividers, or tags**. Icons themselves remain neutral.

---

## 3. Archetype-coded colors (icon accent only)

Archetypes get **one restrained accent color**, applied as:

- Icon stroke
- Small dot
- Subtle glow on hover

**Never fill the whole card.**

| Archetype | Color | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Explorer** | Teal / cyan | Curiosity, motion |
| **Completionist** | Gold (desaturated) | Closure, mastery |
| **Curator / Archivist** | Olive / museum green | Preservation, care |
| **Era Keeper** | Rust / copper | Time, continuity |
| **Variant Hunter** | Violet | Rarity, nuance |
| **Hardware Historian** | Steel gray + blue tint | Systems thinking |
| **Social / Couch Player** | Warm orange | Shared energy |
| **Backlog Ghost / Overwhelmed** | Muted gray-blue | Weight, drift (never shame) |

**Rule:** Only **one** archetype color visible at a time, even if multiple archetypes apply. Pick the strongest.

---

## 4. Neutral & confidence-coded colors (critical)

This is what **prevents overclaiming**.

| Confidence | Color | Used when |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **High** (explicit signals) | Solid accent (full opacity) | Trophies, achievements, playtime |
| **Medium** (strong inference) | Same accent at ~60% opacity | Ownership + patterns, repeated behavior |
| **Low** (soft guess) | Neutral gray | Early signals, cold start, imports only |
| **Collector-only signals** | Olive / parchment tone | Never use: Gold, green checkmarks, trophies |

**Rule:** Copy + color must agree. If the language says “It looks like…”, the color must be **muted**.

---

## 5. Icon rules (so things don’t get noisy)

- **Default icon color:** Neutral off-white / light gray
- **Color only appears when:**
  - Archetype is “Strong” or “Core”
  - Or user taps/expands the card
- **One card = one color story**
- **Shareables:**
  - Era color as background gradient
  - Archetype color as icon accent
  - Text stays white/gray

---

## 6. Example combinations (sanity check)

| Copy | Card background | Icon | Confidence |
|------|------------------|------|------------|
| “As a PS2-era Completionist…” | Deep indigo | Flag/check in muted gold | Full opacity |
| “You own a lot of 90s JRPGs” | PS1 slate | Archive box in olive | Medium opacity. Copy avoids “played”. |
| “Your habits are shifting” | Neutral charcoal | Trend arrow in gray | No archetype color at all |
