# GameHome identity surfaces

What shows up on GameHome: strip (3 items), drawer content, and rules so it feels real without overwhelming.

## Identity Strip (3 items)

Keep the strip to **exactly 3 chips**:

1. **Primary Archetype**  
   Could be play-based (e.g. Completionist, Explorer) or collector-based (e.g. Archivist, Era Keeper). One chip: name + strength pill (Emerging / Strong / Core).

2. **Primary Era**  
   Label from era theme: Modern, PS2/Xbox/GC, HD Era, etc. One chip: era name + short line (e.g. “Your library leans Modern”).

3. **Top Signal**  
   Single highest-leverage signal, one of:
   - **Achievements** (trophies / achievements earned)
   - **Hours** (playtime)
   - **Platforms** (unique platforms)
   - **Owned** (library size / owned count)

No fourth chip unless we add Evolution later; keep it to three so it doesn’t overwhelm.

## Archetype Drawer

When the user opens the drawer for their primary (or a selected) archetype:

- **Header:** Archetype name + strength tier pill.
- **One-liner / headline** from the archetype definition (e.g. “You collect with intent — and it shows.”).

### For collector archetypes only

Include these two sections so it feels grounded and trust-building:

- **“Why we think this”**  
  Short list of the signals we used, in plain language:
  - Owned games (library size)
  - Top era share (how concentrated in one era)
  - Era spread (e.g. era_entropy or span)
  - Platforms (unique platform count)

- **“What this isn’t”** (one small, trust-building line)  
  Clarify that ownership ≠ play/completion so we don’t overclaim.

  **Example for Archivist:**  
  “Owning doesn’t imply completion — it reflects your collection.”

  Use a single sentence per collector archetype. Tone: neutral, clarifying, not defensive.

## Summary

| Surface        | Content                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strip**      | 3 items: Primary Archetype, Primary Era, Top Signal (Achievements/Hours/Platforms/Owned). |
| **Drawer**     | Header, headline, strength; for **collector** archetypes add “Why we think this” (signals) and “What this isn’t” (trust line). |

Keep language rules from `identity-evaluation-rules.md`: collector copy uses **own / collect / curate** only; never **played / completed** when the signal is ownership.
