# Evolution Icon Pairs (Locked v1)

Clean, systematized icon pairing set for ultra-compact evolution tags. Designed to work with a **single icon morph (left → right)** or as **before/after glyphs** on cards, tooltips, and shareables.

Icons are described **conceptually** so you can map them to Lucide / Phosphor / Material without bikeshedding.

**Implementation notes:**
- Treat these as **semantic pairs**, not literal emojis.
- One icon on the left, one on the right; subtle arrow or fade between.
- On **tiny cards**, show only the **right-hand icon** (destination state).
- On **hover / expand**, reveal the full transition.
